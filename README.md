**Conway's Game of Life**

Conway's Game of life is a cellular automaton created by J.H Conway.  
The game depicts how complex shapes can be created from simple patterns.  
This project uses Java to implement Conway's game of life.  

`To Play`

To play, click a few cells on the board, then hit next.   

When a cell is clicked, it turns blue and is "Alive". 
If the cell has less than 2 or more than 3 adjacent alive cells, it will die.   
If it has two or three live adjacent cells it will either stay alive or come to life.
